# Welcome to JSConf Korea!

JSConf Korea is a community conference that pushes the boundaries of what can be created using JavaScript, and an opportunity for people with diverse experiences to share their stories and positive energy with each other.

Our mission is to make the Korean technology community more daring, more diverse, and more human; in short, we just want to make things better.

This year, we come to you as _JSConf Korea 2020 Home Edition_. We're taking things online so that everyone can stay safe (and comfy). We can't wait to meet you all there!
