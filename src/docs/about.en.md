# Welcome to JSConf Korea!

# About

JSConf Korea is a community conference that pushes the boundaries of what can be created using JavaScript, and an opportunity for people with diverse experiences to share their stories and positive energy with each other.

Our mission is to make the Korean technology community more daring, more diverse, and more human; in short, we just want to make things better.

# Seoul

Seoul is a vast and vibrant city of art, technology, and two thousand years of history. When youâ€™re not attending the conference, explore the city with its ultra-efficient subway system that will get you nearly anywhere, including:

- Cafes and pubs in Hanoks with a contemporary spin,
- K-beauty stores with an endless variety of facemasks,
- Muk-bang-worthy food destinations,
- Hiking trails for a half day of hiding away in the nature,
- Well-curated history and art museums

Here is a **[list of the best attractions, cafes, and pubs in Seoul](https://jsconfkorea.com/seoul/)**, personally curated by Sona and Jin, the coffee, beer, and fun connoisseurs.

# Our Team

JSConf Korea is a not-for-profit conference made possible by a team of volunteers.
