# Call for Proposals

# Introduction

We at JSConf Korea believe that progress happens when everyone has a chance to share their perspective. If you've used JavaScript on an exciting project, or have ideas, stories, or even a song to share with us, please submit a proposal! As long as it fits our [Code of Conduct](/en/code-of-conduct), anything’s on the table.

# Why should you give a talk?

## Perks

You will get a ticket to enjoy the conference. The tickets may sell out before the list of speakers is finalized, so if you want to make sure you can attend, please purchase a ticket first and we’ll reimburse you if you get selected.

For all speakers traveling from overseas, we will pay for your travel expenses up to [₩1,200,000](https://www.curvert.com/en/krw-usd/1200000) and arrange your hotel accommodations for 3 nights.

For all speakers traveling from South Korea, we offer a modest amount of honorarium. If you're coming from outside the Seoul Capital Area, we will also pay for your travel and arrange 3 nights at a hotel.

We will book all travel tickets unless you prefer to book your own---we will reimburse you for it.

## Speaker Support

**We welcome new speakers.** If you want to give a talk but are scared of public speaking, or think you are too inexperienced, or are worried about how to put your stories together into a talk, we are here to help.

- We’re happy to review and advise you on your slide deck.
- We’re happy to review your talk in person or via video chat.
- We’ll help you connect with an experienced speaker

Again, whatever else you might need, we’re here to help. Get in touch with us at [contact@jsconfkorea.com](mailto:contact@jsconfkorea.com).

# Talk Format

## Duration

Prepare your talk to be less than **25 minutes long**. You will have 30 minutes for transition, preparation, and the talk.

There is no Q&A time, but you are free to talk with other attendees off stage after your talk.

## Language

All talks must be in either English or Korean. Live interpretation will be provided for both languages.

# Slides and Video Recording

All slides and video recordings of the talks will be shared on our website the [JSConf YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzoVCacndDCfGDf41P-z0iA) and [JSConf Korea YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkHwMMujxwX2s_nxXFsUcLQ). This is for the benefit of the greater JavaScript community and for those who couldn’t make it. We hope you agree, but if you don’t feel comfortable sharing your slides or getting the video published, let us know.

# Selection Process and Criteria

The speaker selection committee will consist of JSConf Korea organizers and volunteers.

The selection process will begin after the submission deadline.

In the first round, the committee evaluates completely anonymized proposals and assign scores based on the following criteria:

- **Relevance of the topic to JavaScript and the JavaScript community**
- Coherence and clarity of proposal
- Novelty and originality of the topic
- Deliverable in given time

The top proposals are then de-anonymized for the committee to finalize the list of speakers. The committee will take speaker details into account in order to ensure a diverse lineup of speakers and to consider travel expenses depending on our finances.

# How to write a proposal

- Please be specific. A topic like “React 101” is way too broad. **Try to deliver an original idea as clearly as possible.**
- If you have many ideas to talk about, please submit them as separate proposals.
- Consider our selection criteria.
- Try to show us your passion!
- If you have something you want to talk about, don’t be discouraged and write that proposal!
