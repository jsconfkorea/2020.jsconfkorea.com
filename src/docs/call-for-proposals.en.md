# Talk Format

## Duration

Prepare your talk to be less than **25 minutes long**. You will have 30 minutes for transition, preparation, and the talk.

## Language

All talks must be in either English or Korean. Your talk will also be live-captioned.

# Slides and Video Recording

All slides and video recordings of the talks will be shared on our website, [JSConf YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzoVCacndDCfGDf41P-z0iA) and [JSConf Korea YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkHwMMujxwX2s_nxXFsUcLQ). This is for the benefit of the greater JavaScript community and for those who couldn‚Äôt make it. We hope you agree, but if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing your slides or getting the video published, let us know.

# Selection Process and Criteria

The speaker selection committee will consist of JSConf Korea organizers and volunteers.

The selection process will begin after the submission deadline.

In the first round, the committee evaluates completely anonymized proposals and assign scores based on the following criteria:

- **Relevance of the topic to JavaScript and the JavaScript community**
- Coherence and clarity of proposal
- Novelty and originality of the topic
- Deliverable in given time

The top proposals are then de-anonymized for the committee to finalize the list of speakers. In order to ensure a diverse lineup of speakers, the committee will take speaker details into account.

# How to write a proposal

- Please be specific. A topic like ‚ÄúReact 101‚Äù is way too broad. **Try to deliver an original idea as clearly as possible.**
- If you have many ideas to talk about, please submit them as separate proposals.
- Consider our selection criteria.
- Try to show us your passion!
- If you have something you want to talk about, don‚Äôt be discouraged and write that proposal!
