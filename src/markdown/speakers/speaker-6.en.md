The project “p5 for 50+” aims to improve the digital literacy and rights of the middle-aged and elderly in South Korea. Addressing the age-specific needs in coding education, the researchers prototyped a low-barrier web app for learning p5.js. In the talk, we will mainly discuss the design implications for accessible education of coding.
