title: 'Say Goodbye to Passwords and Hello to WebAuthn'
---

Dozens of times a day, we identify ourselves to an online entity.

But as the nearly 10 billion leaked accounts documented by [';--have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) attest, this process has a fatal weaknessâ€“passwords.

The Web Authentication API (or WebAuthn) is a standard from the W3C and FIDO that "allows servers to register and authenticate users using public key cryptography instead of a password". WebAuthn is part of a set of standards that enable passwordless authentication between servers, browsers, and authenticators. It's supported in all modern browsers.

This talk will outline how the technologies work, and how you can take advantage of them today to create a far more secure experience for your users.
