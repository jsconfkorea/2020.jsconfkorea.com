If you are familiar with JavaScript, you can start making VR applications right now. Once you have your VR app ready to go, you can go a step further and add Brain.js to start getting insights about how users interact with your app and make real-time updates to the UI.

In this talk, attendees will learn how to start making VR apps, how to integrate Brain.js into a VR project, and how to use this information to make apps more accessible and interesting for users. We will cover some background material on machine learning and VR, then bring everything together in a live demo. By the end of the talk, the audience will know how to put all of these things together in a real, production-like app.
